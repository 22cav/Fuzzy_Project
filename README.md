## Project Outline

### Section 0: Imports

All necessary libraries for mathematical operations, plotting, and fuzzy logic are imported (e.g., numpy, matplotlib).

### Section 1: AlphaFuzzySet Definition

Defines the AlphaFuzzySet class, which models fuzzy sets with custom membership functions and supports alpha-cuts for crisp set generation.

### Section 2: AlphaFuzzySet Testing

Tests the functionality of the AlphaFuzzySet, including membership function behavior, alpha-cuts, and set operations (union, intersection, etc.).

### Section 3: AlphaFuzzyCombination Definition

Defines the AlphaFuzzyCombination class to perform operations on multiple AlphaFuzzySets, including union, intersection, and complement.

### Section 4: Various Combinations Display

Visualizes the results of combining different AlphaFuzzySets using the defined operations.

### Section 5: Further Work

Explores additional applications or extensions of the current fuzzy system.
